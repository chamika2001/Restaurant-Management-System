Configuration and Installation Guidelines:

Step 01: Extracting the Project Files
1. Download the file this github link - https://github.com/chamika2001/book.git
2. Start by extracting the "book-main.zip" file to the "xammp/htdocs" location on your system.
3. This can be done by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Extract Here" or using any file extraction software.
4. rename that extract folder book-main to book

Step 02: Creating and Importing Database
1. Open your web browser and go to "localhost/phpmyadmin/".
2. Create a new database called "book" by clicking on the "New" button and entering the name in the provided field.
3. Once the database is created, navigate to the "sql" folder within the extracted "book" folder.
4. Locate the "book.sql" file and import it into the newly created "book" database.
   - In phpMyAdmin, select the "Import" tab, choose the "book.sql" file, and click on the "Go" button to import the database.

Step 03: Configuring Sendmail Path
1. In the same "sql" folder, find the "php.ini" file.
2. Open the "php.ini" file and go to line 1111.
3. Modify the file location of the sendmail_path to match the location of your "sendmail.exe" file.
   - The default path is "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t", but it may vary depending on your XAMPP installation.
   - Update this path to reflect the correct location of your "sendmail.exe" file.

Step 04: Updating PHP Configuration
1. Delete the existing "php.ini" file located in the "xampp/php" folder.
2. Copy the provided "php.ini" file (which we have given) to the same location.
   - Make sure to keep a backup of your original "php.ini" file before replacing it.

Step 05: Updating Sendmail Configuration
1. Delete the "sendmail.ini" file located in both the "sql" folder and the "xampp/sendmail" folder.
2. Replace them with the provided "sendmail.ini" file.
   - Again, remember to keep a backup of your original "sendmail.ini" files.

Step 06: Restart the xampp
1. You must restart the xampp because the mail is not send before restart.

By following these steps, you will successfully configure and install the project.
